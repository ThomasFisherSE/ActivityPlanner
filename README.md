The main reason I have implemented this is for holiday planning. For some more information on my motivations for this project, see the article on my website [here](https://thomasfisherse.github.io/2024-12-10-ActivityPlanner/).

# Work in Progress
This application is currently a work in progress that I'm implementing in my spare time, so is not completed yet.
