A Windows desktop planner application built with WPF.

The main reason I have implemented this is for holiday planning. For some more information on my motivations for this project, see the article on my website [here](https://thomasfisherse.github.io/2024-12-10-ActivityPlanner/).

# Work in Progress
This application is currently a work in progress that I'm implementing in my spare time, so is not completed yet.

## Future Work
- Canvas-based timetable view
  - Currently using a grid, but planning to implement the timetable as a canvas with blocks drawn on it for each activity slot so that activity slots can partially span time ranges
- Displaying activity icons on timetable
- Location color coding (allow color specification when adding locations)
- Improved activity / location creation UI (currently using initial quick implementation using dialogs)
